# Location-based-news-reccomendation

Our problem is that now a days people getting various news feeds and for them they act like garbage.
Because most of them are useless for users. So it is better if we can arrange news feed according to users preference and categorize them.
So in arranging it is better to organize based on location or user related feeds. So as a result we decide to create user friendly system without wasting their valuable time and their related areas, locations.
